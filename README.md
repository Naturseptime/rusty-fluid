# rusty-fluid
Fluid simulation demo written in Rust, Glium and GLSL.
The Navier-Stokes-equations are computed with Stam's method.
Details of the implementation can be found in the GPU-Gems article.

There is also a [live demo](https://naturseptime.github.io/rusty-fluid-emscripten/) compiled with Emscripten.

Feel free to customize the demo.
